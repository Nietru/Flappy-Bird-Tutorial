# Flappy-Bird-Tutorial
Play file: Built for Windows

## Description:
I followed along with a youtube tutorial for this game, so I could familiarize myself with C#, Unity, and game-creation. All three are completely new to me, so I kept it very basic.

## To Play:
- Double-click: "Play The Game!" directory
- Double-click: "Unzip and play game" file
- click: "view raw" and save to desktop
- Extract-all
- Open "Flappy Bird Tutorial" file
- Press Windows Key or use Task-Manager to escape game
